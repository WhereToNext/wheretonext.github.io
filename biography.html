			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Simon Reich">
			<p>Simon Reich is a multi ward winning musician. His compositions have been heard all around the
				world and currently his Soundcloud page has reached the staggering number of over 1,000,000
				listens! Being a creative composer has also lead to the other profession Simon indulges in,
				production. His ability to oversee projects for other artists, has yielded many fans among the
				music community worldwide. Having recently graduated from SAE creative media institute, has
				also added another string in his bow. That of engineering, both in the studio and in live concert
				environments.</p>
			<p>Simon began playing at 6 years old and at piano lessons he quickly realised that he was much
				more attracted to tunes than reading notes from a page. Simon has played in live bands all his
				life &amp; honed his skills both in composing &amp; musicianship in front of live crowds. Because music
				was such a part of his life, Simon composed new tunes on a daily basis, beautiful these were
				often forgotten or discarded after a few days. That all changed with the advent of home
				recording &amp; now this music can be captured &amp; presented to you. The tunes he records are
				almost all composed as improvised piano beginnings. They are then fleshed out later with
				orchestration of various instruments. Having so many sounds via synthesizers, has made backing
				up these wonderful piano tunes a task Simon has really enjoyed &amp; it certainly adds emotion to
				the final product. This isn‘t to say they aren‘t beautiful tunes to begin with, but there is
				something about an orchestra that really tugs on the heart strings &amp; draws out an emotional
				response. I‘m confident Simon Reich‘s music will bring you hours of inspirational listening &amp; is
				sure to soothe your soul in the process. Enjoy!</p>
